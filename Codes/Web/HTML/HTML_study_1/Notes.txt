HTML - Hypertext markup language

Heading tags
* Starts from <h1> to <h6> : We use these tags as per the requirements of the headings.

Paragraph tags:
* represented by <p> which means paragraph in this we can write content.

Comments:
* <!Comments> this is how comment is given in HTML

Link:
* To provide link we use <a> tag.
* For web pages we use <a href = "url">

* Images:
To inser images we use:- <img src = "path of the image">

List:

* We insert list by using <li> tag
<ul> : this tag is the parent of <li> which means <li> is children of <ul>
eg:- <ul>
        <li>Hello</li>
        <li>Kunal</li>
        <li>Sarpatil</li>
     </ul>
and this tag gives bullets for our list by default

* if you want your list withour bullets we have to declare "list-style:none" in our css file
* for printing the list horizontally we use "float-left" property in css


HTML:
        HTML always has <!DOCTYPE html> declaration to show that this file belongs to HTML
        <html> in between these two tags whole other tags are written</html>
        <head> in between these tags only settings are written </head>
        <body> between these tags all content which is visible to browser is written </body>

        eg: <head> 
                <meta charset = "utf-8"> //character encoding
                <link rel = "stylesheet" href = "stylesheet.css"> //link to stylesheet page
                <title>MY Webpage</title> //title for the page
            </head>

* We always divide our Webpage in three parts header, main and footer 
for our better understading we can divide parts of the resp components with the help of <div> tag
<div class="header">
<div>

<div class = "main">
</div>

<div class = "Footer">
</div>

<span>: If you want to change color of any single word from a text.
and declare it into css
eg: HTML: <h1>
        Welcome to the <span>coding</span> world.
        </h1>
    
    CSS: span {
            color: red;
        }










                                                    
                                                 CSS

CSS: css is used to give color, size, spacing to our HTML page
css file is written different from the HTML file it works on the(where, what and how)

comments can be given in '/* */'

eg: h1 {
    color : red;
}
here, 
    h1 : where
    color : what
    red : how

** For changing font size we use font-size : 40px (here px is its unit).
** For font family we simply use font-family.
** For background color "background-color" is used.
** For height and width "height" and "width" is used respectively.
h1 {
    color : red;
    font-family : serif;
    font-size : 20px
    height: 50px;
    width : 500px;
}

Whenever we want to change color or any single attribute from the list then we must have to specify
a class in HTML and likewise with same class name we can make changes to it's apperrance 

kunal.html
<ul>
    <li class = "KUnal">Kunal</li>
</ul>

kunal.css
.Kunal {
    color: red:

}

Padding: for padding we use "padding:20px" in css

Border: For giving border or a single line from left to right has 3 parameters thickness, style, color
        we can give different type of borders top, bottom, left, right.

Box :   For each element there always a box which is invisible. Inside that it has padding and outside it
        has margin.
